### Task Matrix

Create type Matrix, which incapsulates two-dimensional array-matrix block of real (double) type.    

Matrix is the cover for a two-dimensional array of real values, storing matrix values with operations of matrix addition, deduction, and multiplication.  

Real type values (double) can be in a matrix, specifying during creation, the number of array rows and columns, which will store these values. After creation, the number of rows and columns is not changed. Values to matrix elements can be set while creating a matrix, and later with the help of an indexer.
